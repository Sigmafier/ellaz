# Engine choice - settled, and the caveat before quoting a number

<!-- Extracted VERBATIM from CLAUDE.md on 2026-08-29, when CLAUDE.md was 164,867 chars

## Engine choice — settled, but read the caveat before quoting a number

**Phaser 4 stays.** Three tournaments compared it head-to-head against real
alternatives on an identical game; the second used a 660-tile scrolling
platformer with physics, enemies and art, and every arm was proven to run the
same simulation via a cross-language checksum before any number counted.

**The operator's eyeball verdict INVERTED the fps ranking** (2026-08-01). The
numbers are correct; they measured the wrong quantity. The ranked workload was
900 sprites against a game that runs ~50 (a batching test a pure renderer wins
by construction), and every probe ran headless at 60 Hz — the one refresh rate
at which the real defect could not appear. **So do not quote the fps/jank column
as a proxy for how a game feels.** Payload, time-to-interactive, integration
cost and dev cost were measured on real artifacts and remain sound — and are
**re-auditable**: the raw rows live in `docs/engine-tournament/data/` (87 round-2
rows, round 1, round 3, plus 12 render screenshots in `evidence/`). Every
published PC cold-TTI figure was re-derived from them to the digit on 2026-08-01.

Three eyeball runs settled it — a named ranking, a blind four-arm re-run, and a
blind three-round pairwise of the apparent winner against Phaser. The pairwise
came back **1-1-tie with no symptom reported**, refuting the one prediction the
earlier runs supported. **Excalibur, Phaser and Kaplay are indistinguishable on
feel; only Pixi is reliably last** — the exact arm the fps table rated joint-
first. A four-way ranking forces an order even when the arms are level, and
that is all "excalibur first" ever was.

**So Phaser stays, and the engine question is closed**: it ties on feel and wins
on dev cost, ecosystem and jank, and its 375 KB is paid once across all ten
games. The real deliverable was never an engine — it is the display-rate fix and
the render interpolation, which protect every game regardless of engine. Full
account, the blind protocols, the three eliminated mechanisms, and a published
claim that turned out to be false:
[`docs/engine-tournament/EYEBALL-VERDICT.md`](../docs/engine-tournament/EYEBALL-VERDICT.md).

**The trap that found it applies to every game we ship**: a fixed 60 Hz
simulation step on a 120 Hz display freezes every second frame. See
`.claude/rules/fixed-timestep-must-match-display.md`. No current game is
exposed — snake steps at a game speed, and the rest are DOM/event-driven.

| Engine | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **Phaser 4** | **Ours.** 60 fps / 0% jank, mounts as a lazy chunk, reuses `logic.ts` verbatim. Its 379 KB is **paid by snake alone** — snake is the only game that imports it (`grep -rln 'from "phaser"' src/`, verified 2026-08-02). It is lazy and precache-excluded, so it costs nothing on a first visit, but "shared across all games" was never true. |
| PixiJS 8 | Credible alternative — same 60 fps, loads 256 ms faster at 36% of the bytes, but it is a renderer: loop, culling and pooling are hand-rolled. Reach for it only if one canvas game is load-critical. |
| Kaplay | **The pick for a static-screen game** — a third bake-off on a match-3 put it ahead of Phaser on desktop and tablet (60 fps / 0.2% jank · 59 fps / 0.0%) at 72 KB and 684 ms, a fifth of Phaser's bytes. On mobile the frame rate ties, but it janks far less (0.5–3.5% vs 5.6–9.3%). Still out for **scrolling** games: no culled tilemap, and it janks every frame on mobile there. |
| Excalibur | Out — but on cost, not on feel. A blind pairwise against Phaser came back 1-1-tie with no symptom reported, so its apparent feel win was a four-way ranking forcing an order between level arms. Slowest JS load of the four (1,916 ms PC / 2,910 ms mobile), though the second-smallest payload at 129 KB. Its 21 fps / 100% jank came from the disqualified stress workload — don't quote it. |
| Defold | Out on integration, not merit — fastest renderer measured, but 3.0 s TTI, iframe-only, can't reuse `logic.ts`. |
| Godot 4 | Out for web. 22.6 s to interactive — fails CrazyGames' 20 s time-to-gameplay bar. Re-tested with idiomatic rendering and still 14 fps / 100% jank, so this is not an implementation artefact. |

Full evidence: **[`docs/engine-tournament/`](../docs/engine-tournament/)** — verdict,
both dossiers, 294 raw measurement rows, the determinism probe and per-arm
renders. **Anything 3D is unevaluated** — all six arms were 2D; that would need a
separate three.js / Babylon / PlayCanvas bake-off.
